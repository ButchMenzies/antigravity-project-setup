# Project Memory

> Agent-maintained record of decisions, lessons, and context.
> Update after completing features, making decisions, or solving problems.
>
> **Maintenance:** When this file exceeds ~100 entries or becomes hard to scan,
> archive older entries to `.agent/memory-archive.md` and keep only the last
> 30 days of entries here. Always keep User Preferences — those never expire.
