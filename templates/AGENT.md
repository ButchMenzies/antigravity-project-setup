# Project Configuration

## ⚠️ New Chat? Start Here — MANDATORY
1. Read this file completely
2. **Read `.agent/memory.md`** — this contains all decisions, lessons, and preferences from prior sessions. You MUST read it before doing any work.
3. Run `/status` to see where things stand
4. **If slash commands (like /status) don't appear in the autocomplete**, close and reopen the project.

## ⚠️ Core Rules (Always Apply)
1. **Before implementation**: Read the plan if one exists (check `.agent/current-plan.md` or `conductor/tracks/`)
2. **Before starting any task**: Scan `.agent/skills/` — read the SKILL.md of any skill relevant to the work
3. **After completing a feature/fix**: Update `memory.md` — run `/update-memory`. **Do not skip this.**
4. **Before ending a session**: Run `/end-session` to wrap up. **Do not end a session without updating memory.**
5. **When you notice repeating patterns**: Suggest creating a skill with `/create-skill`
6. **Don't guess about tools, settings, or platform behaviour.** If you're unsure how something works — especially IDE features, APIs, or config options — say so and verify first. Trust your coding knowledge; verify everything else.

## Available Commands
- `/new-track` — plan a new piece of work
- `/edit` — revise a plan before implementing
- `/implement` — execute a plan with progress tracking
- `/status` — show project status
- `/update-memory` — log a decision, lesson, or preference
- `/end-session` — wrap up the current session
- `/create-skill` — create a reusable local skill
- `/new-project` — scaffold a blank project (choose framework, create structure)
- `/ux-design` — define your product's design direction (personas, brand, visual identity)
