# UI Patterns

> Grows during development. Add patterns as they emerge.

<!-- 
Add entries as you build. Each pattern should describe:
- What it is
- When to use it
- How it connects to the emotional pillar
- Example implementation reference

## Example entry:

### Empty State
**When**: A page or section has no data yet
**Feel**: Encouraging, not empty. Show what's possible.
**Pattern**: Icon + heading (what can be created) + 1-2 sentence explanation + CTA button
**Reference**: `src/components/EmptyState.tsx`
-->
