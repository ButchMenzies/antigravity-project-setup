# Antigravity Project Setup

> **Purpose**: Home base for the Antigravity agent setup system.
> This folder contains the bootstrapper, workflows, skills, and user guide.

## ⚠️ New Chat? Start Here
1. Read this file for context
2. Read `.agent/memory.md` for previous decisions
3. Check what's being worked on

## ⚠️ Core Rules (Always Apply)
1. **Before implementation**: Read the plan if one exists
2. **After completing a feature/fix**: Update `memory.md`
3. **Before ending a session**: Run `/end-session`
4. **When you notice repeating patterns**: Suggest creating a skill
5. **Don't guess about tools, settings, or platform behaviour.** If you're unsure, say so and verify first. Trust your coding knowledge; verify everything else.

## Available Commands
- `/setup` — interactive project onboarding
- `/new-project` — scaffold a new project
- `/new-track` — plan a new piece of work
- `/edit` — revise a plan
- `/implement` — execute with tracking
- `/status` — project status
- `/update-memory` — log decisions, lessons, preferences
- `/end-session` — wrap up session
- `/create-skill` — create a local skill
- `/ux-design` — define your product's design direction (personas, brand, visual identity)
- `/offer-strategy` — build a Grand Slam Offer
- `/lead-strategy` — plan lead generation strategy
- `/capture-target` — capture design data from a live site
- `/recreate-site` — rebuild a site from captured data
- `/compare-site` — fix an existing build against captured target data

## What This Project Is

This is the **setup project** — it contains the system that gets installed into other projects. It is NOT a coding project itself.

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` | Bootstrapper — paste into new projects |
| `USER_GUIDE.md` | Human reference — explains the system |
| `.agent/workflows/` | Slash command definitions (copied to projects) |
| `.agent/skills/create-skill/` | Skill creator (copied to projects) |
| `.agent/skills-catalog.md` | Skills reference |
| `updates/` | Patch documents for existing projects |

## Maintenance Tasks

When modifying this project:
- Keep `AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` as lightweight as possible — it's just a bootstrapper
- If workflows change, create an update document in `updates/`
- Test changes by bootstrapping a fresh project
- Update `USER_GUIDE.md` when adding/changing slash commands
