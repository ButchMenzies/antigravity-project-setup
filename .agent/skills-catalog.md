## Local Skills

Skills created specifically for this project, stored in `.agent/skills/`.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `create-skill` | Create new project-local skills from repeating patterns |

<!-- Add new local skills here as they are created -->

---

## How to Use Skills

1. **Check local skills first** — `ls .agent/skills/`
2. **If none exists** — consider creating one with the `create-skill` skill
3. **For inspiration** — search the global library (see below)
4. **Read the `SKILL.md`** before applying any skill

## Global Skills Reference

The global library is a **reference/inspiration source** — not the primary skill store. Use it to see how others have solved similar problems, then write a local skill tailored to this project.
