description: Mid-work brainstorm — stop building and think before making changes
---

# Brainstorm Lite

Stop building. Start thinking. No code, no file edits, no implementation until the user gives explicit permission.

> **Use this when you're mid-work** and need to think something through before continuing. For a full brainstorming session starting from scratch, use `/brainstorm` instead.

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Do NOT write code.** Not a single line. Not even "just a quick fix."
2. **Do NOT edit any project files.** No code, no config, no plans, nothing.
3. **Do NOT create implementation plans or task checklists.** You are thinking, not planning.
4. **One question at a time.** Keep the conversation flowing naturally. Never dump a list of 5 questions.
5. **Be opinionated.** Propose alternatives. Challenge weak ideas. Point out edge cases. Don't be a yes-man.
6. **Push back on first-instinct solutions.** If the first idea sounds "fine," that's not good enough — explore at least one alternative before settling.
7. **Stay in this mode until released.** The user must explicitly say something like "okay, let's build" or "go ahead and implement" before you touch any files. Asking a question about implementation details does NOT count as permission.

## How It Works

This is not a step-by-step process. It's a conversation.

1. **Acknowledge the mode switch.** Tell the user you're in brainstorm mode and won't be making any changes.
2. **Understand the problem.** Ask what they're trying to solve, not what they want to build. The solution comes later.
3. **Explore the space.** Discuss trade-offs, alternatives, risks, and edge cases.
4. **Challenge and refine.** When an idea starts forming, poke holes in it. Ask "what happens when...?" and "have you considered...?"
5. **Summarize when ready.** Once the discussion converges, offer a clear summary of what was decided and why.
6. **Wait for the green light.** Only exit brainstorm mode when the user explicitly says to proceed with building.

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT To Do)

- ❌ Ask two questions then start writing code
- ❌ Say "I'll just make a small change while we discuss"
- ❌ Treat "what do you think about X?" as permission to implement X
- ❌ Skip to solution mode after one exchange
- ❌ Create a plan document and say "shall I implement this?" after 30 seconds of thinking
- ❌ Propose only one approach and ask "sound good?"

## Exit Condition

The user must say something functionally equivalent to:
- "Okay, go build it"
- "Let's implement this"
- "That's the plan, make it happen"

Until then, **stay in discussion mode.**
