# Update Agent Setup Guide

Use this workflow when you've learned something that should be incorporated into the setup guide.

## When to Update

- After setting up a new project and discovering improvements
- When a step in the guide doesn't work as expected
- When you find a better pattern or tool
- When paths or resources change

## Steps

### 1. Identify the Change

What needs to be updated?
- [ ] A step that didn't work
- [ ] A new pattern or best practice  
- [ ] Path or resource location change
- [ ] New skill to recommend
- [ ] Clarification needed

### 2. Review Current Guide

Read the current guide — it's at the repo root:
```
AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

Identify the specific section(s) that need changes.

### 3. Make the Edit

Edit the guide with the improvement. Be specific:
- Include exact commands or paths
- Add examples where helpful
- Update any dates/timestamps

### 4. Update the Date

At the bottom of the guide, update the creation/modification date.

### 5. Test on a Project (Recommended)

For significant changes:
1. Open a test project in Antigravity
2. Copy-paste the updated guide
3. Follow the instructions
4. Verify everything works

### 6. Document What Changed

Add a note in this workflow's history section (below) about what was changed and why.
