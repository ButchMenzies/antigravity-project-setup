# The AI Confidence Boost

## The Buyer

A solopreneur (or small business leader) who is stretched thin juggling everything. They know AI can help, but they don't know where to start. They've had a play — one minute AI gives them a good result, the next minute a really bad one. Their trust is low, their time is limited, and they feel behind.

## The Dream Outcome

**From:** Overwhelmed and not knowing where to begin
**To:** AI-first, tackling existing and new projects with confidence, knowing how AI can help

## Problems

### Before they start
1. Don't know which AI tools to use (too many options)
2. Don't know which tasks in their business AI can actually help with
3. Afraid of wasting time on another tool that doesn't deliver
4. Inconsistent results eroded their trust ("is it even reliable?")
5. Feel behind — everyone else seems to "get it"

### During the process
6. Get a good result once but can't replicate it
7. Don't know how to give AI good instructions (prompting)
8. Don't know how to evaluate whether the AI output is good enough
9. No system — just ad-hoc experiments with no structure
10. Time pressure — already juggling everything, learning feels like another task

### After they succeed
11. How do they keep up as AI changes fast?
12. How do they apply this to new projects, not just the one they learned on?
13. How do they know they're getting the most out of it?

### Pricing Notes

Price not yet set. Principles to follow:
- Price should reflect value delivered, not hours worked
- The gap between $7,091 and the actual price should feel like a no-brainer
- Premium enough to fund excellent delivery and ensure client commitment
- Consider: $997, $1,497, or $1,997 as anchor points

## Enhancers

### Guarantee (Performance)

> "We'll work with you to master one AI platform that fits your business — whether that's Gemini, ChatGPT, HeyGen, ElevenLabs, or Antigravity. If you don't feel confident using it independently by the end of the program, we keep working with you until you do. No extra charge."

**Type:** Performance guarantee
**Buyer fear addressed:** "What if I still can't do it after paying?"
**Why it works:** Specific (one platform), achievable, outcome-based (confidence), zero risk for buyer

### Scarcity

> "I only work with 3 people at a time."

**Type:** Capacity-based (real)
**Why it works:** Genuine constraint — personalised 1:1/small group delivery means limited spots. Not manufactured.

### Urgency

Not yet defined. Options to consider:
- Launch pricing that increases after a date
- Bonus removal after a deadline
- Cohort-based enrollment windows

### Naming

**Offer name: The AI Confidence Boost**

- Conveys the outcome (confidence), not the mechanism
- Short and punchy
- Doesn't limit the audience (works for solopreneurs, small business leaders, teams)
- Feels like a product, not a service
