# Scaling Frameworks

How to go from "it's working" to "it's working at scale". Two core frameworks: the Rule of 100 (volume) and More Better New (growth strategy).

## The Rule of 100

**The rule:** Do 100 primary marketing actions every day for 100 consecutive days.

```
Pick ONE:
□ 100 warm outreach messages per day
□ 100 cold outreach messages per day
□ 100 minutes of content creation per day
□ $100 per day on paid ads

For 100 days straight.
```

### Why 100?

- **Volume solves most problems.** Before questioning strategy, ask: "Am I doing enough?"
- **Consistency creates compounding.** Day 1 doesn't look like day 100.
- **100 days reveals patterns.** You can't optimise what you haven't measured at scale.
- **100 actions creates data.** Data beats guessing. Every time.

### Common objections (and why they're wrong)

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't have 100 contacts" | You have more than you think. And cold outreach has infinite supply. |
| "100 per day is too many" | Then your offer needs to be sharper (less back-and-forth per lead). |
| "I can't spend $100/day" | Start with free channels. $0 warm + cold outreach until you have revenue. |
| "Quality over quantity" | Do 100 *quality* actions. Volume and quality aren't mutually exclusive. |
| "I tried and it didn't work" | How many days? If less than 100, you stopped too early. |

### How to track Rule of 100

```
Daily Log:
Date: [Date]
Channel: [Warm / Cold / Content / Paid]
Actions completed: [Number]
Responses/Engagement: [Number]
Leads generated: [Number]
Notes: [What worked, what didn't]
```

After 100 days, you'll know:
- Your conversion rates at each stage
- Which messages/content resonate
- What objections come up repeatedly
- Whether the channel works for your business

## More Better New

The framework for scaling what works. In this exact order.

### 1. More (increase volume)

**Do more of exactly what's already working.**

Before trying anything new, ask: "Am I maxing out my current winning channel?"

- If cold email is working → send more cold emails
- If YouTube is working → publish more videos
- If paid ads are profitable → increase budget
- If referrals are coming in → ask for more referrals

**Why "more" comes first:** It's the lowest risk, lowest effort way to grow. The system already works. You're just turning up the dial.

**How to "more":**
- Hire or outsource to increase volume
- Automate repetitive parts
- Extend hours dedicated to the winning channel
- Add more team members to the process

### 2. Better (improve quality/conversion)

**Improve the existing winning channel.**

Once you're doing "more" and hitting volume limits OR diminishing returns, improve quality:

- If cold email is working → A/B test subject lines, improve personalisation, refine follow-up
- If content is working → improve production quality, study what gets shared, deepen topics
- If ads are working → test new creatives, refine targeting, improve landing pages
- If outreach is working → refine the script, improve qualification, shorten sales cycle

**How to "better":**
- A/B test individual components (one variable at a time)
- Study your best-performing assets — what made them work?
- Ask converted leads: "What convinced you?"
- Remove friction at every step of the conversion path
- Track metrics at each stage (impressions → clicks → leads → customers)

### 3. New (expand channels)

**Only after "more" and "better" are exhausted: try a new channel.**

"New" carries the most risk. You don't know if it works yet. You don't have expertise yet. Learning curves are steep.

**When to go "new":**
- ✅ Current channel is maxed out (can't do more, can't do better)
- ✅ You have reliable revenue from existing channels
- ✅ You have capacity to experiment without hurting what works
- ❌ Current channel "feels boring" (boredom isn't a reason)
- ❌ A competitor is doing something cool (copy after validation, not on hype)
- ❌ You saw a shiny tactic on social media

**How to "new":**
1. Pick one new channel based on where your persona spends time
2. Commit 100 days (Rule of 100) before evaluating
3. Don't reduce effort on winning channels to fund the experiment
4. Track separately so you can compare apples to apples

## Lead Quality vs. Quantity

Volume matters, but not all leads are equal.

### Lead quality hierarchy

| Quality | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Referral** | Someone vouched for you | Warm outreach, satisfied customers |
| **Inbound** | They came to you | Content, SEO, word-of-mouth |
| **Engaged** | They raised their hand | Lead magnet, webinar, reply to outreach |
| **Targeted cold** | Right profile, no relationship | Cold outreach, paid ads |
| **Untargeted** | Random scraped list | Bad cold outreach, spray-and-pray |

**The goal:** Move leads UP the quality ladder. Cold becomes warm through value. Warm becomes engaged through lead magnets. Engaged becomes referral through great delivery.

### When quantity beats quality

- You're just starting (need data)
- Testing a new channel (need volume for statistical significance)
- Validating a new offer (need responses to learn)

### When quality beats quantity

- You're capacity-constrained (can't serve more)
- High-ticket offers (few sales needed, each must be right fit)
- Reputation-sensitive markets (bad fits create negative word-of-mouth)
