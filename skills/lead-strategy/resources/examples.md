# Lead Generation Examples

Annotated examples showing lead strategy frameworks applied to different business types.

## Example 1: B2B SaaS (Project Management Tool)

### Situation
New project management tool targeting agencies with 5-20 employees. Have a working product, a few beta users, no marketing budget.

### Strategy

**Starting channels:** Warm outreach + Content

**Phase 1: Warm Outreach (Month 1-2)**

```
Channel: Warm Outreach
Target: Agency owners in personal network + LinkedIn connections
Volume: 100 personalised messages/day
```

**Outreach message:**
```
Hey [Name],

I saw your agency's work on [specific project] — the [specific detail] was really well done.

I've been building a PM tool specifically for agencies your size. We're solving the problem where project updates live in 5 different apps and nobody knows what's actually on track.

Would you be up for a 10-min demo? I'd love your honest feedback — even if it's "this isn't for us."

Either way, nice work on that [project]. Keep it up.
```

**Why this works:**
- Personalised (references their work)
- Value proposition is specific (not "better project management")
- Low-friction ask (10 min, feedback-framed, not a hard sell)
- Warm close (compliment, not pressure)

**Phase 2: Content + Lead Magnet (Month 2-4)**

```
Lead Magnet: "The Agency Health Check: Score your operations in 5 minutes"
Format: Interactive quiz → email results + recommendations
Platform: LinkedIn articles + short-form posts
Volume: 100 minutes of content creation/day
```

**Why this lead magnet works:**
- Narrow problem: "Are my agency operations healthy?"
- Quick to consume: 5-minute quiz
- Reveals the core problem: Low score → "you need better systems" → core offer
- Valuable: Specific, actionable recommendations

## Example 2: Service Business (Business Coaching)

### Situation
Business coach specialising in helping solopreneurs land their first 10 clients. Has a $2,000 coaching package. Some testimonials from free coaching.

### Strategy

**Starting channels:** Warm outreach + Content

**Lead Magnet: "The First Client Playbook"**
```
Format: 5-page PDF
Contents:
1. The 3 questions to identify your first client (5 min exercise)
2. The exact message template to send (fill in the blanks)
3. The follow-up sequence (3 messages over 7 days)
4. What to charge for your first engagement
5. CTA: "Want step-by-step help landing clients 2-10? Book a free strategy call"
```

**Why this lead magnet works:**
- Solves Problem A (first client) → reveals Problem B (clients 2-10 = core offer)
- Actionable — they can send the message template TODAY
- Short — 5 pages, done in one sitting
- Named compelling — "The First Client Playbook" = clear benefit

**Content strategy:**
```
Platform: LinkedIn (where solopreneurs hang out)
Content pillars:
1. Client acquisition tactics (how-to)
2. Mindset shifts for new solopreneurs (empathy)
3. Client success stories (social proof)

Cadence: 5 posts/week
Format: Short text posts with one clear takeaway each
CTA: "Want the full playbook? Link in comments"
```

**Warm outreach script (for people who engage with content):**
```
Hey [Name], I noticed you've been engaging with my posts about [topic].

Are you currently working on landing your first clients? If so, what's your biggest sticking point?

I just published a free playbook that walks through exactly how to get your first client this week. Want me to send it over?
```

**Why this works:**
- Content attracts the right people (solopreneurs interested in getting clients)
- Engagement = signal of interest → outreach to engaged people is warm, not cold
- The playbook provides genuine value
- The outreach is helpful, not salesy

## Example 3: E-commerce (Specialty Coffee)

### Situation
Online specialty coffee subscription. Average order $30/month. Good product, loyal existing customers, want to grow beyond word-of-mouth.

### Strategy

**Starting channels:** Content + Paid ads

**Lead Magnet: "The Brew Guide: Make café-quality coffee at home in 3 minutes"**
```
Format: Beautifully designed PDF + video
Contents:
- The 3 common mistakes that make home coffee taste bad
- The simple ratio that fixes everything (15:1, explained)
- Water temperature matters more than you think
- The 1 upgrade that changes everything (spoiler: fresh beans → subscription)
- CTA: "Try our roaster's choice for $1 (first month)"
```

**Why this lead magnet works:**
- Persona pain: "My home coffee doesn't taste as good as the café"
- Quick win: They'll make better coffee tomorrow morning
- Reveals the gap: Great technique + mediocre beans = still not great → subscription solves this

**Paid ad strategy:**
```
Platform: Instagram + Facebook
Targeting: Coffee enthusiasts, home brewing, specialty coffee interests
Ad creative: 30-second video showing the "3-minute brew" method
CTA: "Get the free brew guide"
Daily budget: $100/day
Funnel: Ad → Brew guide opt-in → Email nurture (3 emails) → $1 trial offer
```

**Email nurture sequence:**
```
Email 1 (immediate): The brew guide + "one more tip" bonus
Email 2 (Day 2): "The bean difference" — why freshness matters (educate)
Email 3 (Day 4): $1 trial offer + customer photos/testimonials
```
