# The Core Four

The four fundamental ways any business generates leads. Every lead generation method in existence is a variation of one of these.

**Start with one. Master it. Then expand.**

## 1. Warm Outreach

**What it is:** One-to-one communication with people who already know you.

**Audience:** Friends, family, existing customers, past clients, social media followers, email subscribers, professional network.

**Why it works:**
- Trust already exists — they know you, so conversion is easier
- No cost — just time and effort
- Fastest path to first sales and testimonials
- Best for validating a new offer before scaling

**How to do it well:**
1. **Make a list** — every person you know who might benefit OR know someone who would
2. **Reach out personally** — not a mass message; reference something specific about them
3. **Lead with value** — offer help, insight, or a genuine compliment before mentioning your offer
4. **Use the ACA framework:**
   - **Acknowledge** — "Hey [name], I saw you [something specific]"
   - **Compliment** — "That's really impressive because [reason]"
   - **Ask** — "I'm working on [thing]. Do you know anyone who [has this problem]?"
5. **Ask for referrals** — even if they're not the right fit, they might know someone who is
6. **Follow up** — most people don't respond to the first message; follow up 2-3 times

**Volume target:** 100 personal outreach messages per day until warm list is exhausted.

**When to start with this:** Always. Every business starts here. It's the fastest path to revenue and social proof.

**Limitations:** Finite audience. You'll eventually reach everyone you know. That's when you expand to cold outreach and content.

## 2. Cold Outreach

**What it is:** One-to-one communication with people who don't know you yet.

**Audience:** Anyone who matches your ideal customer profile but hasn't heard of you.

**Why it works:**
- Unlimited audience — there are always more people you don't know
- Scalable — can hire, automate, and systematise
- Direct — you choose exactly who to reach
- Fast feedback — you know quickly if your message resonates

**How to do it well:**
1. **Build a targeted list** — identify exactly who you want to reach (industry, role, company size, location)
2. **Research before reaching out** — reference something specific about them or their business
3. **Lead with value** — share an insight, offer a free resource, or identify a specific problem they have
4. **Make cold feel warm:**
   - Reference their specific work, content, or achievement
   - Mention a shared connection if one exists
   - Personalise the first line — never start with "Dear Sir/Madam"
5. **Follow up persistently** — 3-7 touchpoints over 2-4 weeks
6. **Track response rates** — test and refine messages based on data

**The cold outreach formula:**
```
Line 1: [Personalised reference to their work/situation]
Line 2: [Identify a specific problem or opportunity they have]
Line 3: [Briefly mention how you solve it — 1 sentence]
Line 4: [Low-friction CTA — "Would a quick 10-min call make sense?"]
```

**Volume target:** 100 outreach attempts per day.

**Channels:** Email, LinkedIn, DMs, phone calls, even physical mail.

**When to start:** After warm outreach has generated initial results and social proof. Social proof makes cold outreach dramatically more effective.

## 3. Content Creation

**What it is:** Creating and distributing free content to attract an audience.

**Audience:** Warm audience (followers) + cold audience (new discoverers via algorithms, search, shares).

**Why it works:**
- Builds trust at scale — one piece of content reaches hundreds or thousands
- Compounds over time — every piece adds to a growing library of value
- Attracts inbound interest — people come to you
- Demonstrates expertise without selling
- Creates warm leads for outreach

**How to do it well:**
1. **Choose your platform** — go where your persona spends time (not where you're most comfortable)
2. **Define content pillars** — 3-5 topics you consistently create about
3. **Give real value** — teach, don't tease. Show the *what* and the *how*, not just the *that*
4. **"Give until they ask"** — provide so much free value that people seek your paid offer
5. **Every piece has a CTA** — follow, subscribe, download lead magnet, reply, etc.
6. **Consistency > perfection** — a weekly post for 52 weeks beats a viral post followed by silence

**Content types by effort and reach:**

| Type | Effort | Reach | Shelf Life |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| Short-form text (tweets, posts) | Low | Variable | Short |
| Short-form video (reels, TikTok) | Medium | High | Medium |
| Long-form text (articles, newsletters) | Medium | Medium | Long |
| Long-form video (YouTube) | High | High | Very Long |
| Podcast | High | Medium | Long |

**Volume target:** 100 minutes of content creation per day.

**When to start:** Alongside warm outreach. Content builds the audience that makes all other channels more effective.

## 4. Paid Ads

**What it is:** Paying to put your message in front of a targeted audience.

**Audience:** Cold (primarily) — people who don't know you, selected by demographics, interests, or behaviour.

**Why it works:**
- Fastest way to reach a large audience
- Highly targetable — demographics, interests, lookalikes, retargeting
- Scalable — spend more, get more (when the economics work)
- Predictable — once dialled in, you can forecast leads and revenue

**How to do it well:**
1. **Know your numbers** — what can you afford to pay per lead? Per customer?
2. **Start with the offer** — the ad is just the vehicle; the offer does the selling
3. **Test creatives** — 3-5 variations of images/video and copy
4. **Use lead magnets** — don't go straight to sale; capture interest first
5. **Retarget warm audiences** — people who visited your site, watched your video, engaged with content
6. **Track everything** — cost per lead, cost per customer, ROAS

**The paid ad funnel:**
```
Ad (interruption) → Lead Magnet (value exchange) → Nurture (content/email) → Offer (conversion)
```

**Budget target:** $100/day minimum (the Rule of 100). Lower spend = slower learning.

**When to start:** After the offer is validated (warm and cold outreach have proven it converts). Don't pour money into an unproven offer.

## Channel Compounding

The Core Four aren't isolated. They compound:

- **Content** creates a warm audience for **warm outreach**
- **Warm outreach** generates testimonials that improve **cold outreach** and **ads**
- **Paid ads** build an audience for **content** and create warm leads for **outreach**
- **Cold outreach** with content links feels warmer and converts better

**The flywheel:** Start with 1, add channels as each one works. Don't try to run all four at once from day one.

## Channel Selection Guide

| Situation | Start With |
|-----------|------------|
| Brand new, no audience, no budget | Warm outreach |
| Some audience, no budget | Warm outreach + content |
| Proven offer, some budget | Content + paid ads |
| Proven offer, proven ads | All four — scale what works |
| Not sure what works yet | Warm outreach (fastest feedback) |
