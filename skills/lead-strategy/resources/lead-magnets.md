# Lead Magnets

A lead magnet is a free, valuable offer given in exchange for contact information. It bridges the gap between "stranger" and "engaged lead".

## The Principle

**"Give until they ask."**

Provide so much free value that people naturally seek out your paid offer. The lead magnet is the first taste — it should be good enough to charge for.

## What Makes a Great Lead Magnet

| Criteria | ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Problem** | Solves one narrow, specific problem | Tries to cover everything |
| **Connection** | Naturally leads to the core offer | Unrelated to what you sell |
| **Value** | Good enough to sell | Obvious freebie quality |
| **Consumption** | Can be consumed in under 10 minutes | Requires hours of commitment |
| **Outcome** | Delivers a quick win or "aha moment" | Just information with no result |
| **CTA** | Clear next step toward core offer | Ends with no direction |

## The Seven-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Problem and the Person

Pick one narrow problem that your ideal buyer has. Not "marketing" — "writing your first cold email".

```
The person: [Who specifically]
The problem: [One narrow problem they have right now]
Why this problem: [How it connects to your core offer]
```

### Step 2: Figure Out How to Solve It

Create the simplest, most effective solution to that one problem. This should be actionable — after consuming it, they should be able to do something they couldn't do before.

```
The solution: [Specific approach]
The result: [What they can do after consuming this]
```

### Step 3: Choose the Delivery Format

Match the format to the problem and the persona:

| Format | Best For | Consumption Time |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **PDF/Guide** | Step-by-step processes, checklists | 5-10 min |
| **Template** | Fillable frameworks, swipe files | 2-5 min |
| **Video** | Demonstrations, tutorials | 5-15 min |
| **Tool/Calculator** | Interactive problem-solving | 2-5 min |
| **Quiz/Assessment** | Self-diagnosis, personalisation | 3-5 min |
| **Mini-course** | Multi-step problems | 15-30 min |
| **Free trial/sample** | Software, physical products | Varies |
| **Webinar/Workshop** | Complex topics, community building | 30-60 min |

**Rule of thumb:** Shorter is better. The faster they get the win, the more they want the next thing.

### Step 4: Name It

The name should convey the benefit, not the format.

**Naming formula:**
```
The [Adjective] [Noun]: [Specific Result] in [Timeframe]
```

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Free PDF Guide"
- ❌ "Marketing Tips Ebook"
- ✅ "The Cold Email Playbook: Book 5 meetings this week"
- ✅ "The Revenue Calculator: Find your hidden $50K in 10 minutes"
- ✅ "The First Client Blueprint: Land your first paying client in 7 days"

### Step 5: Make It Easy to Consume

- Remove everything that isn't essential
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include action steps (not just information)
- Design for mobile if digital
- Include a progress path ("Step 1 of 5")

**Test:** Can someone complete it in one sitting? If not, trim.

### Step 6: Make It Exceptionally Good

This is where most lead magnets fail. They hold back the good stuff for the paid offer.

**Don't do that.**

Give away your best thinking for free. The lead magnet proves you can deliver. If the free thing is mediocre, why would anyone pay for more?

**"But won't they just use the free thing and never buy?"**

No. The lead magnet solves one problem. Solving that problem reveals the next problem — which your core offer solves. That's the connection.

### Step 7: Include a Clear Call to Action

After consuming the lead magnet, the person should know exactly what to do next.

```
CTA options:
- "Ready for the full system? [Link to offer]"
- "Want help implementing this? [Book a call]"
- "Join [community/list] for more like this"
```

The CTA should feel like a natural next step, not a hard sell.

## Lead Magnet → Core Offer Connection

The lead magnet should create a gap that the core offer fills:

```
Lead Magnet: Solves Problem A
             ↓
             Solving Problem A reveals Problem B
             ↓
Core Offer:  Solves Problem B (and C, D, E...)
```

**Example:**
- Lead magnet: "The Cold Email Playbook" → teaches how to write cold emails
- Result: They start getting responses → but don't know how to convert responses into sales
- Core offer: "The Sales Acceleration Program" → teaches the full pipeline from email to close
