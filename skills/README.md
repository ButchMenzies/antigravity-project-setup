# Skills Library

Curated, tested skills from real Antigravity projects. When bootstrapping a new project, the agent checks here first before falling back to the [reference library](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills).

## How Skills Get Here

1. A skill is created in a project via `/create-skill`
2. The workflow automatically uploads it to this repo under `skills/`
3. Future projects can copy it directly instead of re-creating it

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `planning` | Principles for iterative, grounded planning — plan what you can see, learn first, then re-plan |

## Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
└── SKILL.md          # The skill definition
```

Skills may optionally include additional files (scripts, examples, templates) alongside SKILL.md.
