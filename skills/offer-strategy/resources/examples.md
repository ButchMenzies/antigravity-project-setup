# Offer Examples

Annotated before/after examples showing how the offer-strategy frameworks transform weak offers into compelling ones.

## Example 1: Freelance Web Designer

### Before (Weak Offer)
```
Web Design Services

- Custom website design
- Mobile responsive
- SEO optimized
- 3 revision rounds
- Price: $2,500
```

**Why it's weak:** It's a feature list. Every web designer offers the same things. No dream outcome, no risk reversal, no value stack. Competing purely on price.

### After (Grand Slam Offer)
```
The Revenue-Ready Website System

You get:
- Custom conversion-focused design ($3,000 value)
  → Not just "a website" — a site engineered to turn visitors into customers
- Your Competitor Teardown Report ($500 value)
  → We analyse your top 3 competitors and build your site to beat them
- 90-Day SEO Launchpad setup ($1,200 value)
  → Start ranking from day one, not day 180
- The "What To Post" Content Calendar ($297 value)
  → 30 days of social media content to drive traffic to your new site

Total Value: $4,997

Your Investment: $3,500

Guarantee: If your new site doesn't generate at least 10 qualified
leads in the first 60 days, I'll rebuild your key pages for free.

Only 3 spots available per month (I build every site personally).
```

**What changed (mapped to frameworks):**

| Framework | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Dream Outcome | "A website" | "A site that generates leads" |
| Perceived Likelihood | Nothing | Competitor research + guarantee |
| Time Delay | Unknown | "90-Day SEO Launchpad" = results faster |
| Effort & Sacrifice | Client figures it out | Content calendar + done-for-you setup |
| Scarcity | None | 3 spots/month (real — solo designer) |
| Guarantee | None | Performance-based, specific |
| Naming | Generic service name | "The Revenue-Ready Website System" |
| Price Anchoring | None | $4,997 value shown vs. $3,500 price |

## Example 2: Online Fitness Coaching

### Before (Weak Offer)
```
12-Week Fitness Coaching

- Customized workout plan
- Nutrition guidance
- Weekly check-ins
- Private messaging support
- Price: $299
```

**Why it's weak:** Describes the mechanism (12 weeks of coaching), not the transformation. Every fitness coach offers the same structure.

### After (Grand Slam Offer)
```

Your transformation includes:
- Your Custom Training Blueprint ($600 value)
  → Built for your body, your schedule, your equipment

  → Accountability + form review + real-time adjustments
- The "Never Miss a Monday" Habit System ($197 value)
  → The behavioural framework that makes consistency automatic

10 pounds and feel noticeably stronger, I'll coach you for another
12 weeks free until you do.

```

**What changed:**

| Framework | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Dream Outcome | Implied | "Lose 10 pounds, feel noticeably stronger" |
| Effort & Sacrifice | Client plans own meals | Done-for-you meal planner |
| Bonuses | None | Travel survival guide solves a real sub-problem |
| Guarantee | None | Conditional + specific outcome + generous |
| Naming | "12-Week Fitness Coaching" | "The Body Reboot" |

## Example 3: SaaS Product

### Before (Weak Offer)
```
Project Management Tool

Plans starting at $9/month
- Unlimited projects
- Team collaboration
- Time tracking
- Reporting dashboard
```

**Why it's weak:** Feature-driven. Sounds like every other PM tool. No transformation, no differentiation.

### After (Grand Slam Offer)
```
Ship projects on time. Every time.

The Launchpad Plan — $29/month

Everything you need to stop missing deadlines:
- Smart Timeline Engine → auto-adjusts when things change

- One-Click Status Reports → stop spending Friday afternoons on updates
- Team Pulse Check → know who's overloaded before they burn out

BONUS: The "First 30 Days" Setup Service (free)
→ We'll import your projects and configure your workspace. You just show up.

Switch from [competitor] in under an hour.
If you're not shipping faster within 30 days, cancel. No questions asked.
```

**What changed:**

| Framework | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Dream Outcome | None stated | "Ship projects on time. Every time." |
| Effort & Sacrifice | Manual migration | Done-for-you setup service |
| Time Delay | Unknown | "Under an hour" to switch, 30 days to see results |
| Naming | Generic feature names | Benefit-named features ("Bottleneck Detector") |
| Guarantee | None | Unconditional, 30-day, zero friction |

## Pattern: The Transformation Test

For any offer, apply this template:

```
Before this offer: [What life looks like — specific pain]
After this offer: [What life looks like — specific gain]

The mechanism: [How they get from before to after — but DON'T lead with this]
```

If you can't fill in "before" and "after" with specific, vivid descriptions, the offer isn't ready.
