# Offer Enhancers

Five tools that take a solid offer and make it irresistible: scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees, and naming.

## 1. Scarcity (limit quantity)

Scarcity answers: "Why can't I get this later?"

**Types of real scarcity:**

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Physical** | Limited units or spots | "Only 20 spots available" |
| **Cohort** | Limited enrollment window | "Next cohort starts March 1" |
| **Capacity** | You can only serve so many at once | "I take 5 clients per quarter" |
| **Resource** | Limited supply of a component | "Includes 1-on-1 time (capped at 10 clients)" |

**Rules:**
- Must be real. Manufactured scarcity destroys trust and reputation.
- If it's always available, don't pretend it isn't.
- Scarcity works best when paired with proof of demand.

## 2. Urgency (limit time)

Urgency answers: "Why should I act now?"

**Types of real urgency:**

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Deadline** | Offer expires at a specific time | "Enrollment closes Friday" |
| **Price increase** | Price goes up after a date | "Early-bird pricing ends March 1" |
| **Bonus removal** | Bonuses disappear after deadline | "Book this week and get the bonus audit" |
| **Seasonal** | Tied to a natural event/cycle | "Before the new financial year" |

**Rules:**
- Must honour the deadline. If you say it closes, close it.
- Explain what changes after the deadline (price, bonuses, availability).
- Don't run perpetual "limited time" offers. The market notices.

## 3. Bonuses (increase perceived value)

Bonuses answer: "What else do I get?"

**Principles:**
- The combined value of bonuses should *exceed* the value of the core offer
- Each bonus should solve a real problem (not filler)
- Each bonus should be something you could charge for separately
- Name each bonus with its benefit, not its format

**Bonus design process:**
1. Look at the problem list from the offer creation
2. Find problems the core offer doesn't fully solve
3. Create small, specific solutions for those problems
4. Package them as named bonuses with individual values

**Bonus types:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tool/Template** | Something they can use immediately | "The 90-Day Revenue Planner (Value: $297)" |
| **Training** | Additional knowledge | "Cold Outreach Masterclass (Value: $497)" |
| **Access** | Community or expert access | "6 months in the private community (Value: $600)" |
| **Done-for-you** | Something you create for them | "Your custom funnel audit (Value: $1,500)" |
| **Speed** | Accelerates results | "Quick-start setup call (Value: $500)" |

**Naming bonuses:**
- ❌ "Bonus PDF"
- ✅ "The Quick-Win Playbook: Get your first client in 7 days (Value: $297)"

## 4. Guarantees (reverse risk)

Guarantees answer: "What if it doesn't work?"

**Types of guarantees:**

| Type | How it works | Risk level | Best for |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Unconditional** | Money back, no questions asked, within timeframe | High (for you) | Digital products, low-cost offers, high-confidence delivery |
| **Conditional** | Money back if specific conditions are met | Medium | Coaching, programs where effort matters |
| **Anti-guarantee** | "All sales final" stated confidently | Low | Premium offers where commitment matters |
| **Implied** | Track record and social proof do the heavy lifting | None | Established brands with strong reputation |
| **Performance** | Results guaranteed or you continue for free | Variable | Service businesses with measurable outcomes |

**Crafting a strong guarantee:**
1. Identify the buyer's biggest fear about purchasing
2. Address that fear directly
3. Be specific about the terms (timeframe, conditions, what they get back)
4. Make the guarantee itself a selling point

**Examples:**
- **Unconditional:** "Try it for 30 days. If you don't love it, email us and we'll refund every penny. No questions, no hassle."
- **Conditional:** "Follow the program for 90 days. If you don't see [specific result], we'll refund your investment in full."
- **Performance:** "If we don't generate [X result] in [Y timeframe], we'll keep working for free until we do."

## 5. Naming (make it memorable)

Naming answers: "What is this thing?"

**A great offer name should:**
- Convey the result, not the mechanism
- Be memorable and distinct
- Stand alone without explanation
- Feel like a *thing* — a defined product/program, not a generic service

**Naming approach:**
1. Start with the transformation: what changes?
2. Add specificity: timeframe, quantity, or method
3. Test: does someone immediately understand the value?

**Naming patterns:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Result] + [Timeframe] | "The 90-Day Launch Accelerator" |
| [Adjective] + [Noun] | "The Revenue Blueprint" |
| [Number] + [Outcome] | "The 5-Client Kickstart" |
| [Action] + [Result] | "Scale Without Burnout" |

**Naming this is NOT:**
- ❌ "8-Week Coaching Package"
- ❌ "Business Consulting Services"
- ❌ "Premium Tier"
- ✅ "The Grand Slam Growth Program"
- ✅ "The Zero-to-Launch Accelerator"
- ✅ "The Revenue Engine"

## Enhancer Stacking Order

When presenting an offer, the order matters:

1. **Core offer** — the main transformation
2. **Value stack** — all included solutions with individual values
3. **Bonuses** — additional value (each named and valued)
4. **Total value vs. price** — the anchor and reveal
5. **Guarantee** — remove the last objection
6. **Scarcity/Urgency** — create a reason to act now
