# Writing Frameworks

Principles extracted from the three named influences, adapted for Empowered Growth's mentor voice.

## Alex Hormozi — Value-First, Problem-Solution

**Core principle:** Lead with value. The reader should know what they gain in the first sentence.

### Key patterns:
1. **Conciseness** — Under 200 characters for hooks. Short sentences. Present tense. Active voice. No adverbs.
2. **Problem-Solution structure** — Name the pain first, then the path out. Don't just list features.
3. **Specificity** — "Save 4 hours a week" beats "save time". Concrete numbers build trust.
4. **Benefits over features** — Don't say what it does. Say what changes.
5. **Minimize perceived effort** — Make the next step feel small and achievable.

### How we adapt it:
Hormozi's style is more aggressive/sales-forward than our mentor voice. We take the structure (value-first, specific, concise) but soften the delivery. No urgency tactics, no scarcity pressure. The mentor doesn't need to sell. They guide.

## Dan Koe — Clear, Not Clever

**Core principle:** Write so clearly that a busy person scanning on their phone gets the point in 3 seconds.

### Key patterns:
1. **PASTOR framework** (Problem, Amplify, Story, Testimony, Offer, Response) — useful for longer content
2. **Transformation focus** — Always define Point A (where they are) and Point B (where they want to be)
3. **"You are the niche"** — Solve your own problems, then share those solutions
4. **Rule of 3** — Three main points, three sub-points. Balance and readability.
5. **Start with misconceptions** — "Most people think X. Here's what actually works."

### How we adapt it:
Koe's frameworks are excellent for structuring landing pages and sections. The transformation model maps perfectly to our persona's journey (from AI confusion → AI-first confidence). We use the clarity but drop the personal brand emphasis.

## Michael Stelzner — Practical, Write for One Person

**Core principle:** Picture one real person. Write as if you're explaining to them. This makes copy natural, focused, and accessible.

### Key patterns:
1. **How-to structure** — Be practical. Tell them exactly what to do.
2. **GPS model** (Go, Push, Shine) — Research, draft for a specific person, then refine
3. **Storytelling** — Illustrate concepts with real examples, not abstract theory
4. **Audience-first** — Understand what they actually need, not what you want to say
5. **Authority through value** — Earn trust by being genuinely helpful, not by claiming expertise

### How we adapt it:
Stelzner's "write for one person" maps directly to our persona (Sam the Curious Solopreneur). His practical how-to approach is our mentor voice in action. We use the audience-first mindset as our primary filter.

## Synthesis: The Empowered Growth Writing Formula

Combining all three into a simple framework:

1. **Pain** — Name what they're feeling (Hormozi: problem-first)
2. **Empathy** — Show you understand (Stelzner: audience-first)
3. **Path** — Show the transformation, not just the destination (Koe: Point A → Point B)
4. **Proof** — Be specific about outcomes (Hormozi: concrete numbers)
5. **Next step** — Make it small and inviting (all three: minimize friction)
