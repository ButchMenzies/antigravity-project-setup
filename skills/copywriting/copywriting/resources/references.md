# Influence References

What makes each influence distinctive, and what we borrow vs. leave behind.

## Alex Hormozi

**What makes him distinctive:**
- Extreme brevity. His posts are often under a tweet. Every word earns its place.
- Uses numbers relentlessly. "$100M", "10x", "60% faster". Specificity builds trust.
- Problem-solution-result structure in almost everything.
- Aggressive, high-energy delivery. Strong opinions, strong hooks.

**What we borrow:**
- Value-first structure. The reader knows what they get before they decide to keep reading.
- Specificity. "Save 4 hours a week" not "save time".
- Short sentences. No fluff.

**What we leave behind:**
- The hustle energy. Our mentor is calm, not intense.
- Scarcity and urgency tactics ("limited spots", "act now"). The mentor doesn't pressure.
- The aggressive sales posture. We guide, not push.

## Dan Koe

**What makes him distinctive:**
- Frameworks for everything. PASTOR, PAS, APAG. Structured thinking applied to writing.
- "Clear, not clever" as an explicit principle. No wordplay, no metaphor overload.
- Transformation-centric. Every piece of content defines a before and after.
- Personal experience as proof. "I did this, here's what happened."

**What we borrow:**
- The transformation model. Persona's Point A → Point B is our backbone.
- "Clear, not clever". This is our anti-AI-copy principle.
- Structured content. PASTOR works well for our landing page sections.

**What we leave behind:**
- The personal brand emphasis. We're a service, not a personality.
- The philosophical tone. Koe goes deep on existential themes. We stay practical.
- Social media optimization patterns. We're writing UI, not tweets.

## Michael Stelzner

**What makes him distinctive:**
- "Write for one person" as first principle. Picturing a real human makes copy natural.
- Relentlessly practical. How-to oriented. Step-by-step.
- Authority through generosity. Gives away the strategy, sells the implementation.
- Storytelling as illustration, not decoration.

**What we borrow:**
- Write for Sam (our persona). Every sentence should feel like it's addressed to them.
- How-to orientation. Lead with action, not theory.
- Earn trust by being useful, not by claiming credentials.

**What we leave behind:**
- The scale of content production (weekly podcasts, massive blog). We're writing website copy.
- The social media focus. Stelzner's context is platform strategy. Ours is product UI.
