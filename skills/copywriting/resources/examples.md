# Before/After Examples

Annotated rewrites showing the copywriting principles in action. Each example explains *why* the rewrite works.

---

## Example 1: Hero Headline

### Before (corporate/businesslike)
> We Coach AI First Teams That Actually Drive Growth

**Problems:**
- Starts with "We" (company-centric, not reader-centric)
- "AI First Teams" is jargon the persona might not identify with
- "Actually Drive Growth" is vague. What kind of growth?

### After (mentor voice)
> Stop guessing with AI. Start getting real results.

**Why it works:**
- Addresses the reader directly ("Stop... Start...")
- Names the pain ("guessing") from the persona's actual experience
- "Real results" is specific enough to resonate without being hyperbolic
- Two short sentences. Scannable. Clear.
- Feels like a mentor saying "here's what we're going to fix"

## Example 2: CTA Button

### Before
> Contact

**Problems:**
- Transactional. Feels like a form.
- No indication of what happens next.
- Low warmth, high friction.

### After
> Let's talk

**Why it works:**
- Collaborative ("let's" implies together)
- Low pressure. It's a conversation, not a commitment.
- Matches the mentor voice. A mentor doesn't say "submit your inquiry".
- Two words. No friction.

## Example 3: Pain Point Card

### Before
> ⚠️ Overwhelm & Scattered Tools
> Too many tools, no clear path.
> 👉 The Jumpstart gives you a 90-day roadmap so you know exactly where to begin.

**Problems:**
- Alert icon (⚠️) implies danger/error. The persona already feels anxious.
- "Overwhelm & Scattered Tools" is a label, not empathy.
- 👉 emoji feels informal and generic.
- Jumps straight from "you have a problem" to "buy our thing".

### After
> 🧭 Too many tools, no clear direction
> You've tried ChatGPT, heard about Claude, downloaded three apps. But nothing sticks because there's no plan behind it.
> We start with a clear roadmap so you know exactly what to focus on first.

**Why it works:**
- Compass icon (🧭) suggests guidance, not alarm.
- Opens with empathy. Names specific things they've done (ChatGPT, Claude).
- "Nothing sticks because there's no plan" validates their experience instead of blaming them.
- "We start with" is collaborative. It's a mentor offering to walk alongside.
- "What to focus on first" is specific and actionable.

## Example 4: Mission Statement

### Before
> Transforming AI Chaos into Real Business Opportunities

**Problems:**
- "Transforming" + "Opportunities" is corporate-speak.
- "AI Chaos" is dramatic. The persona is confused, not in chaos.
- Passive. Who's doing the transforming?

### After
> Most businesses know AI matters. They just don't know where to start. We show you how.

**Why it works:**
- Three sentences. Progressive. Each builds on the last.
- "Most businesses" normalizes the struggle. You're not behind, you're normal.
- "We show you how" is the mentor promise in four words.
- No jargon, no buzzwords. Could be said over coffee.

---

## Example 5: Error Message

### Before
> Something went wrong. Please try again or email us directly.

**Problems:**
- "Something went wrong" is vague and slightly alarming.
- Generic. Doesn't help the user know what to do.

### After
> That didn't go through. Check your connection and try again, or message us and we'll sort it out.

**Why it works:**
- "Didn't go through" is specific and calm.
- Gives a concrete next step (check connection).
- "We'll sort it out" is the mentor stepping in. Reassuring.
- No blame. No jargon. No alarm.

---

## Example 6: Empty State

### Before
> No data yet.

### After
> Nothing here yet. That's about to change. Hit "Get started" and we'll walk you through your first step.

**Why it works:**
- "That's about to change" is forward-looking and encouraging.
- "We'll walk you through" is the mentor voice in action.
- "First step" reduces perceived effort. You don't need to do everything. Just one step.
