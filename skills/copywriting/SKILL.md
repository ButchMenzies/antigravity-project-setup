description: Grammar, tone, and punctuation conventions for all user-facing text in RaiseMyGame
---

# Copywriting Conventions

Follow these rules when writing or editing **user-facing text** — UI labels, descriptions, help content, tooltips, banners, onboarding copy, and error messages.

## Tone
- **Encouraging, clear, and concise.** Write like a supportive coach, not a textbook.
- Use **second person** ("you", "your") — speak directly to the athlete.
- Avoid jargon. Use simple language that a 16-year-old athlete would understand.

## Punctuation
- **No em dashes (—)** in user-facing text. Use periods, commas, or colons instead.
  - ❌ "Start with your foundation — it guides everything"
  - ✅ "Start with your foundation. It guides everything."
- **No semicolons** in UI copy. Split into two sentences if needed.
- Use **sentence case** for headings and button labels (e.g., "Create training block", not "Create Training Block").
  - Exception: proper nouns and product names ("Raise My Game", "Prime", "Circle of Support").

## Formatting
- Keep sentences **under 25 words** wherever possible.
- One idea per sentence.
- Use **active voice**.
  - ❌ "A training block can be created"
  - ✅ "Create a training block"

## Common Terms (use consistently)
| Term | Not |
|------|-----|
| training block | plan, programme |
| competency | skill, ability |
| Circle of Support | support network |
| foundation | values/identity (when referring to the feature) |
| session | workout, practice (when referring to a scheduled training session) |

## Empty States
When a page has no data, include:
1. A relevant icon or illustration
2. A clear heading (what can be created)
3. A brief explanation (1-2 sentences, why it matters)
4. A call-to-action button

## Error Messages
- Lead with what happened: "Couldn't save your changes"
- Follow with what to do: "Try again or check your connection"
- Never blame the user

## Code Comments
- Em dashes and informal punctuation are fine in code comments — this convention applies only to user-facing strings.
