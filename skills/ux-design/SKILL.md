# UX Design

Ensures every UI decision connects to the product's design foundation. Read the `.agent/ux/` knowledge base before building, and update it after.

## Use this skill when

- Building any new user-facing screen, page, or component
- Designing a user flow or interaction pattern
- Writing user-facing copy (use alongside `copywriting` skill)
- Reviewing or critiquing existing UI
- A new feature needs a journey map

## Do not use this skill when

- Working on backend/API code only
- Building internal tooling where design direction doesn't apply
- The project has no `.agent/ux/` folder (suggest running `/ux-design` first)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Design Foundation

Before any UI work, read these files (if they exist):

1. **`.agent/ux/persona.md`** — Who am I building for? What are they feeling?
2. **`.agent/ux/design-direction.md`** — What emotional pillar guides this product? What's the transformation?
3. **`.agent/ux/brand.md`** — How should this product sound and feel?
4. **`.agent/ux/colors.md`** — What palette am I using and what does each color mean?
5. **`.agent/ux/typography.md`** — What fonts and scale?
6. **`.agent/ux/patterns.md`** — Is there an established pattern for this type of UI?
7. **`.agent/ux/journeys/`** — Is there a journey map for this feature?

If any critical file is missing (persona, design-direction, brand), suggest running `/ux-design` before proceeding.

### Step 2: Pre-Build Checklist

Before writing UI code, answer these questions:

- [ ] **Who**: Does this screen serve the persona's needs and emotional state?
- [ ] **Feel**: Does the design match the emotional pillar? (Check adjectives in design-direction.md)
- [ ] **Transformation**: Does this screen contribute to the user's transformation, or is it just... there?
- [ ] **Voice**: Does the copy match the brand voice?
- [ ] **Differentiation**: Am I using the curated palette and typography, or falling back to defaults?

### Step 3: Differentiation Check

Before finalizing any UI, check against these common "vibe-coded" defaults:

| Element | 🚫 Generic default | ✅ Intentional alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Color | Framework defaults or random Tailwind | Curated palette from `colors.md` |
| Typography | system-ui / Inter (unless deliberately chosen) | Fonts from `typography.md` with rationale |
| Layout | Standard card grid, uniform spacing | Layout that serves the content and journey |
| Motion | None or generic fade-in | Purposeful animation tied to meaning |
| Empty states | "No data yet" + button | Encouraging, showing what's possible |
| Loading | Spinner | Skeleton or contextual loading that maintains layout |
| Copy | Generic labels ("Submit", "Items") | Persona-appropriate language from `brand.md` |

### Step 4: Journey Mapping (for new features)

When building a new feature, map the emotional journey before designing screens:

1. **Arrival** — What emotion does the user bring? (Confused? Curious? Anxious?)
2. **First value** — How quickly do they feel "this is for me"? (Target: < 30 seconds)
3. **Investment** — What makes them put something of themselves into it?
4. **Reward** — What's the "I did it" moment?
5. **Return** — Why do they come back?

Save the journey map to `.agent/ux/journeys/[feature-name].md`.

### Step 5: Post-Build Update

After completing UI work, check if this revealed anything new:

```
UX Knowledge Update:

- [ ] New UI pattern established → update patterns.md
- [ ] New journey mapped → create journeys/[feature-name].md
- [ ] Color usage refined → update colors.md
- [ ] Persona insight discovered → update persona.md
- [ ] Brand voice evolved → update brand.md
- [ ] Competitive reference found → update competitive.md
- [ ] Typography usage clarified → update typography.md
- [ ] No updates needed
```

Update the relevant files. This keeps the design knowledge growing with the product.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping the persona read** — building UI without knowing who it's for leads to generic design
- **Treating design-direction.md as decoration** — if the pillar says "calm confidence" but the screen is cluttered and loud, the file isn't doing its job
- **Empty patterns.md** — after 3+ screens, this file should have entries. If it's still empty, you're not capturing patterns
- **Ignoring the differentiation check** — one quick scan catches 80% of "looks like every other app" issues
- **Copy-pasting UI patterns** — reusing component code is fine, but every screen should be checked against the persona and journey
